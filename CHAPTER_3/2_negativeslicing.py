# negative slicing Count the number of characters in the string
# And then what you have to do is to subtract the negative integer,
#  for example, in Harry 5 characters.
#  So we subtract 4 from 5 which gives us 1 and 1 from 5 which gives us 4.
#  So the slicing which we have to do is from one is to 4 that is a r  r is the output.
#substract from length (negative slicing)\
